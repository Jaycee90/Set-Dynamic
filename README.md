# Set-Dynamic
DATA STRUCT & ALGO
You are to provide the implementation for a second specification/design for the new data type described in Assignment 1.

This design removes the upper-bound limitation (with respect to the number of distinct values that can be accommodated) associated with the compile-time, fixed-sized array version. The main changes in class specification (relative to the Assignment 1 version) are summarized below:
